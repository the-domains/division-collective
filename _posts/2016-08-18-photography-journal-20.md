  I'm always a fan of an impromptu photowalk so when Richard Harris invited me
  to hang with his friends Jess, Jonathon, Ed, Zsuzsa and Koray I jumped at the
  opportunity. It was literally my first day out with the new Canon 7D so I was
  still getting adjusted to the multitude of functions it offered.
