  Earlier this month I attended the FashTech Summit in London to represent
  UNSIGNED GRP and get the latest industry insights from marketers and brands
  who are shaping this exciting fashion technology landscape. When it was
  launched in 2014, FashTech was a simple meet up that focused on start-ups and
  panel discussions.
