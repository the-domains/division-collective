  A few weeks ago I was invited to the LN-CC concept store in Dalston to check
  out their latest designer fashions and take some pictures of the space to
  share with you guys. LN-CC is a high-end, appointment-only concept store that
  features hip designer fashions, music, books and an onsite bar.
