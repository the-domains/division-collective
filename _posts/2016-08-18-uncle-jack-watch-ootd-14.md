  Men tend to misunderstand women when it comes to shoes. "Surely one pair is
  enough!" they'll exclaim and yet if you give any man a choice of beautiful
  watches they'll say "Can I keep them ALL?". As women are drawn towards elegant
  products, men are drawn towards the intricate and mechanical.
